## <div id='chapter1'>pattern matching</div>
> In CSS, pattern matching rules determine which style rules apply to elements in the document tree. These patterns, called selectors, may range from simple element names to rich contextual patterns. If all conditions in the pattern are true for a certain element, the selector matches the element.  

在CSS中模式匹配规则决定哪些样式适用文档树中的元素，这些模式称为选择器，从简单的节点到丰富的上下文，如果所有情况下这个模式适用于确定的元素，那么选择器匹配元素
